# TicTacToeCollaborative
A simple terminal tic-tac-toe game to learn the basics of sockets and threads in java.
Created as a collaborative project for coding club with John Olson.

Made with the help of https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/sockets/ (taught us sockets in general) and https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/javanetexamples/ (gave us the idea to store the enemy socket so we could easily send out data)
